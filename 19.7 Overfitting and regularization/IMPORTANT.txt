L1 & L2 regularization
pros & cons of lasso vs ridge
where they are both used



Q&A
---------
1. Explain bias &var tradeoff from a model's perspective

a model is highly biased, leads to high error in prediction. <---oversimplified, overtrained
variance doesn't generalize well on test data. <--- too complex

2. Why sparse matrix data works with Naive bayes? because it fulfills one of its 
requirements which is independence of features

revise PCA & eigenvalues
