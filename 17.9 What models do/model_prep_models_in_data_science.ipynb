In data science, this is an example of the so-called **recommendations systems**. Read this nontechnical blog post of [Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639) about how they model their recommendations systems. Then, derive the features they use in their recommendations engines and discuss what else can be incorporated into this model. \n",
