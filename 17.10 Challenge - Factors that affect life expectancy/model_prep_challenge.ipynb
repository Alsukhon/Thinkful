    "# Challenge: Factors that affect life expectancy\n",

    "Throughout this module, we dove deep into the topics of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and its substeps. Now it's time to apply your knowledge. In this challenge, you'll work with the [Life Expectancy dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/home) from Kaggle. The data is collected from the websites of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and World Bank (WB). The dataset contains annual variables for many of the countries in the world which are divided into several broad categories: immunization related factors, mortality factors, economical factors, and social factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should access the data from the Thinkful database. Here's the credentials you can use to connect to the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "postgres_user = 'dsbc_student'<br>\n",
    "postgres_pw = '7\\*.8G9QH21'<br>\n",
    "postgres_host = '142.93.121.174'<br>\n",
    "postgres_port = '5432'<br>\n",
    "postgres_db = 'lifeexpectancy'<br>\n",
    "table_name = 'lifeexpectancy'<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this challenge, submit a Jupyter notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks. Moreover, you can also submit a kernel to the Kaggle containing your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your goal in this challenge is to find the factors that affect the life expectancy. Specifically, you need to find out which factors increase the expected life in the countries and which factors decrease it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, load the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detect the problems with the data such as missing values and outliers. Are there any nonsense values that seem to be stemmed from the data collection? For the missing values, discuss which technique would be the most suitable one in filling out these values. Regarding the outliers, discuss their potential effects on your analysis and select an appropriate method to deal with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore the data using univariate and multivariate exploration techniques. You should pay special attention to your target variable. In this regard, your focus should be on finding the relevant variables that may affect life expectancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the feature engineering step, you need to select a suite of variables that you think would be ideal in the modeling phase. More concretely, you may discard some variables that are very correlated with the other ones or the variables that you think irrelevant with the life expectancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Summarize your findings. One of the most important skills of a data scientist is to convey ideas and findings to nontechnical people using understandable language. In this regard, one of the most effective ways to communicate your ideas is to do it using effective visualization."
