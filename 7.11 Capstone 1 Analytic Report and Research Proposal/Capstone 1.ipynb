Dynamic page loading means that the store page displays the apps based on what Google knows about the user requesting the page, commonly known as *user behavior*.

    "- App Category: Category of the app. This could be beauty, business, entertainment, education...etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rating: How users rate the app out of 5, with 1 being the lowest rating and 5 being the highest.\n",

It is most likely the applications generated are based on their popularity in the geographical region around India, while this analysis is intended for audience in the U.S or North America.\n",

    "- With cloud-based storage available for Android users at little or no cost, app size may have no significant contribution to app popularity. Therefore the `Size` column will be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- I am not sure if apps follow the same software versioning process, therefore I will assume the `Current Ver` column will be irrelevant to this analysis. Otherwise it would have been useful for measuring current support of the app by its developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- I will assume that the vast majority of users can upgrade their Android devices to the latest version. Based on that, the `Android Ver` column will also be excluded. Any limitations that may justify relying on older versions of Android most probably do not apply to the majority of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scraping data off of a Google website is an unconventional way to obtain it, which may result in misplaced data. This largely depends on the scraper built by the dataset creator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sentiment analysis result is limited by the abilities of Python's nltk library, which does not support all languages. Reviews with unsupported languages will not be translated,should have no values within the analysis, and therefore will be removed."

However, there is also more extreme positive polarity for free apps, shown in the area from 0.5 to 1.00 on the x axis, the extremity is also evident for free apps in negative polarity extending from -0.50 to -1. The majority of sentiments for free apps is concentrated around neutral and mildly positive. Polarity of sentiments for free apps has more spread around 0.\n",

    "The polarity mean difference between two samples is 0.045 within a range of 2 (from -1 to 1), which is considered a small difference. A slightly higher standard deviation can be seen for free apps, which is causing the wider spread of observations around their polarity mean. This also may be the reason for paid app polarity observations being a bit more clustered around their mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several reasons can provide justification for both **A.** having a higher standard deviation for polarity of free apps and **B.** paid app polarity being at a visible minimum of -0.5. One cause that jumps to mind and can justify both phenoma, is that free apps have looser terms and conditions for being published; an android developer can code an app in a relatively short time and put it on the market for free without having to have established real value for app users. On the other side, paid apps -who are able to compete in the Google Play store- are expected to have more robust value-producing technology within the app, which convinces the user of purchasing."

In other words, it says that this difference found in paid apps, for example, is not unusual to find in free apps.

I conclude the polarity is statistically significantly different between paid and free apps, given the polarity p-value is really small, and that subjectivity may need a larger sample size to confirm that the subjectivity is not significantly differnt, given its p-value of 0.18. This tells that people may maintain the same subjectivity in general when posting reviews for either type of app, but do tend to be somewhat more extreme when writing reviews on free apps."
