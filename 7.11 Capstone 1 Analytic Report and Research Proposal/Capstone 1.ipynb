    "The limitations of the Google Play Store Apps data are:\n",

    "1. The apps included are relevant to the dataset creator's activity on Google-related sites. She is a Machine Learning Software Developer based in India. It is most likely the applications generated are based on their popularity in the geographical region around India, while this analysis is intended for audience in the U.S or North America.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With cloud-based storage available for Android users at little or no cost, app size may have no significant contribution to app popularity. Therefore the *Size* column will be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I am not sure if apps follow the same software versioning process, therefore I will assume the *Current Ver* column will be irrelevant to this analysis. Otherwise it would have been useful for measuring current support of the app by its developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I will assume that the vast majority of users can upgrade their Android devices to the latest version. Based on that, the *Android Ver* column will also be excluded. Any limitations that may justify relying on older versions of Android most probably do not apply to the majority of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scraping data off of a Google website is an unconventional way to obtain it, which may result in misplaced data. This largely depends on the scraper built by the dataset creator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The sentiment analysis result is limited by the abilities of Python's nltk library, which does not support all languages. Reviews with unsupported languages will not be translated and should have no values within the analysis output."
