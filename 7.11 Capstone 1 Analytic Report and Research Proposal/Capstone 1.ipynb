    "The limitations of the Google Play Store Apps data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The apps included are relevant to the dataset creator's activity on Google-related sites. She is a Machine Learning Software Developer based in India. It is most likely the applications generated are based on their popularity in the geographical region around India, while this analysis is intended for audience in the U.S or North America.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With cloud-based storage available for Android users at little or no cost, app size may have no significant contribution to app popularity. Therefore the *Size* column will be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I am not sure if apps follow the same software versioning process, therefore I will assume the *Current Ver* column will be irrelevant to this analysis. Otherwise it would have been useful for measuring current support of the app by its developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I will assume that the vast majority of users can upgrade their Android devices to the latest version. Based on that, the *Android Ver* column will also be excluded. Any limitations that may justify relying on older versions of Android most probably do not apply to the majority of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scraping data off of a Google website is an unconventional way to obtain it, which may result in misplaced data. This largely depends on the scraper built by the dataset creator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The sentiment analysis result is limited by the abilities of Python's nltk library, which does not support all languages. Reviews with unsupported languages will not be translated and should have no values within the analysis output."

    "The polarity of a sentiment measures how negative or positive the context is, regardless of other factors. In the sentiment analysis data that we have, the polarity ranges from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive). In general, polarity can indicate whether people have strong opinions about a certain topic.\n",

However, there is also more extreme positive polarity for free apps, shown in the area from 0.5 to 1.00 on the x axis, the extremity is also evident for free apps in negative polarity from a little less than -0.75 to -0.50. The majority of sentiments for free apps is concentrated around neutral and mildly positive. Polarity of sentiments for free apps has more spread around 0.\n",

    "The polarity mean difference between two samples is 0.047 within a range of 2 (from -1 to 1), which is considered a small difference. What is noticeable is the higher standard deviation for free apps, which is causing the wider spread of observations around their polarity mean. This is also the reason for paid app polarity observations being a bit more clustered around their mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several reasons can provide justification for both **A.** having a higher standard deviation for polarity of free apps and **B.** paid app polarity being at a visible minimum of -0.5. One cause that jumps to mind and can justify both phenoma, is that free apps have looser terms and conditions for being published; an android developer can code an app in a relatively short time and put it on the market for free without having to have established real value for the app's user. On the other side, paid apps -who are able to compete in the Google Play store- are expected to have more robust value-producing technology within the app in order to convince the user of purchasing."

    "The t-value of 0.99 says that the difference between the two sample is similar to the variance within each sample. In other words, it says that this difference found in paid apps, for example, is not unusual to find in free apps. That is because the difference is almost equal to the variance *within* paid apps, and therefore may expectedly be reproduced if we re-do the test using a different random sample from the free apps population.\n",
