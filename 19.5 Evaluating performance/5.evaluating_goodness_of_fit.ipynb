Recall that there are two contexts where we care about performance: in relation to the training set and in relation to a test set.

Namely, if the p-value of the F-test for our model is less than or equal to 0.1 (or even less than or equal to 0.05), we say that our model is useful and contributes something that is statistically significant in the explanation of the target.\n",

    "R-squared is probably the most common measure of goodness of fit in a linear regression model. It is a proportion (between 0 and 1) that expresses how much variance in the outcome variable is explained by the explanatory variables in the model. Generally speaking, higher $R^2$ values are better to a point โ a low $R^2$ indicates that our model isn't explaining much information about the outcome, which means it will not give very good predictions. However, a very high $R^2$ is a warning sign of overfitting. No dataset is a perfect representation of reality, so a model that perfectly fits our data ($R^2$ of 1 or close to 1) is likely to be biased by quirks in the data and will perform less well on the test set.\n",

    "As we said before, high R-squared values are generally desirable. However, in some cases, very high R-squared values indicate some potential problems with our model. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very high R-squared value may be a sign of overfitting. If our model is too complex for the data, then it may overfit the training set and do a poor job on the test set. That said, there's not an agreed upon threshold for R-squared to detect overfitting. Instead, it requires a comparison between performance on test and training data. **If our model performs significantly worse on the test set compared to the training set, then we should suspect overfitting**. We'll discuss how to evaluate linear regression models in the test set on the next checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "* R-squared is an inherently biased estimate of the performance in the sense that the more explanatory variables are added to the model, the higher R-squared values we get. This is so even we include irrelevant variables like noises or random data. To mitigate this problem, we usually use a metric called **adjusted R-squared** instead of R-squared. Adjusted R-squared does the same job as R-squared, but it is adjusted according to the number of features included in the model. Hence, **it's always safer to look at the adjusted R-squared value instead of R-squared value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A note on negative R-squared values**: It is possible to get negative R-squared values for some models. In general terms, if a model is weaker than a straight horizontal line, then R-squared value becomes negative. This usually happens when a constant is not included in the model. Getting a negative value for R-squared means that your model does very poorly in explaining the target. "

Often, we try several models and evaluate their performance on a test set in order to determine the top performing one.

Unfortunately, the two metrics suffer from some drawbacks that make them inappropriate to use in certain situations.\n",

    "Using information criteria is also a common way of comparing different models and selecting the best one. Here, we talk about two information criteria known as the **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** and **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**. Both take into consideration the sum of the squared errors (SSE), the sample size, and the number of parameters.\n",

Although we can use either of the two criteria, AIC is usually criticized for its tendency to overfit. In contrast, BIC penalizes the number of parameters more severely than AIC and hence favors more parsimonious models (that is, models with fewer parameters)."
