    "Whether we are working on an established dataset for a personal project (i.e., a dataset from Kaggle) or a brand new dataset for work, the first step is to establish the **variable type** of each feature in our dataset. From there we are able to identify *how* to clean the data by scrubbing it of any potential problems for future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a programmer might think in terms of strings, integers, floats, or booleans, a data scientist sees variables as either **continuous** or **categorical**. The essential difference here is continuous variables can take a potentially unlimited number of values while categorical variables can take only a limited number of categories as their values. \n",

    "This distinction between the two variable types influences how we approach a data science problem. As we will see later in this course, if our target variable is continuous, then we formulate the problem as a **regression problem**. If the target variable is categorical, then we formulate it as a **classification problem**. More immediately, each type of variable requires different EDA techniques. \n",

    "#### Continuous variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous variables can take an infinite number of potential values. This is probably the most common variable type you will encounter when working on a dataset. Some real-world examples of continuous variables include speed, distance, weight, height, and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 sub-types of continuous variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Interval variables\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables are sensitive to both rank-order and distance. Temperature is a good example. The distance between 30 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit is the same as the distance between 70 and 80 degrees (10 degrees). We can also say that 80 degrees is higher than 70 degrees, which is higher than 40 degrees. This means that we can rank-order this variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The crucial distinction about interval variables is that they lack an absolute zero point**. For example, a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit does *not* mean that there is no warmth in the air at all! The lack of a \"true zero\" means that we cannot logically calculate ratios from an interval variable. For example, we cannot say that 60 degrees F is \"twice as hot\" as 30 degrees F.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval variables can be treated as either categorical or continuous variables. If we are comfortable with the assumption that a continuous variable naturally has an absolute zero point, then we can treat interval variables as continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Ratio variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of continuous variable is the **ratio variable**. Ratio variables indicate rank and distance, and have a meaningful absolute zero value. When a ratio variable has a score of 0, then none of the quantity measured by the variable is present. The presence of a \"true zero\" is the main distinction between ratio and interval variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, age is a ratio variable: Someone who is \"0 years old\" has not been born, which means that a 20-year-old has lived twice as long as a 10-year-old."

    "# Categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, a categorical variable can take only a limited number of distinct values, called \"categories\". As a rule of thumb, if a variable can only take a finite number of values, that variable can be treated as a categorical variable. However, this guideline is not rigid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about a variable like age, for example. While we claimed age as a continuous variable above, it is unclear whether there really is a fixed or unlimited number of values that can take. Biologically, of course, we can effectively say there is a range on the ages a human can take. \n",
    "\n",
    "But consider a dataset collected from college students, or working adults, or retirees. In these cases, there is in practice a limited number of values that age might take. So, depending on the analysis it make sense to treat age as a categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 sub-types of categorical variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Nominal variables\n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable is nominal, the ordering between categories does not matter. For example, if we have a variable indicating the origin country of a product, that variable is categorical because it can only take the given number of countries that exist. On top of that, it's a nominal variable because a rank-ordering of countries is meaningless. Relationships such as \"greater than,\" \"less than\" or \"equal to\" are not clearly defined among values of a nominal variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Ordinal variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal variables indicate a rank-ordering among categories. For example, runners might be scored as 1 for 1st place, 2 for 2nd place, 3 for 3rd place, and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, an ordinal variable does not give any information about the *distance* between the scores. We know that the 1st place runner was faster than the 2nd place runner, but the difference in their *times* (the distance between them within the variable) could be minutes or milliseconds. In addition, the difference in times between 1st and 2nd place is probably not the same as the difference in times between 2nd and 3rd place."
